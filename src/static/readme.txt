A theme for the les3pics.fr website.

== Description ==

This is officially a theme for [www.les3pics.fr](https://www.les3pics.fr). It was constructed from [TwentySeventeen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/) and [Underscores](https://underscores.me/), with inspiration from [SKT Adventure Lite](https://www.sktthemes.net/shop/free-travel-blog-wordpress-theme/).

However, the theme can also be seen as a starter if you want to use common web development tools:
 - A ready-to-use [docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/) Wordpress + MariaDB setup
 - [Yarn][] to handle build dependencies
 - [Webpack](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the building tool with watch feature
 - [SCSS]( https://sass-lang.com/) for styling
 - SVG icon font

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
